# Reed–Solomon Visual Lab

An interactive mathematical notebook for learning Reed–Solomon codes, Hamming distance, and list decoding in the context of STARKs. Built with TypeScript, React, and Vite, with a white paper-like interface, editable tapes, typeset mathematics, and green Hamming balls.

This is a frontend package inside the research repository. It shares the repository's Git history with the Rust code, Markdown notes, and future Lean work.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```sh
cd web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. Each experiment has its own URL under `/visuals/`. The application computes locally in the browser and requires no API keys or backend.

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

`pnpm run build` checks TypeScript and writes the production site to `dist/`. `pnpm test` runs mathematical, serialization, and interaction tests. `pnpm run test:watch` watches tests during development.

Use `pnpm run format` to format the frontend's TypeScript, styles, configuration, and documentation with Prettier.

## Implemented experiments

| Step | Experiment           | Interactions                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01   | Tape to polynomial   | Edit integers modulo the selected field, add/remove slots with buttons, and follow each coefficient into its polynomial term.                       |
| 02   | Build a codeword     | Change the rate or evaluation count; inspect modular evaluation arithmetic and the resulting output tape.                                           |
| 03   | Measure errors       | Edit aligned reference/received rows; each unequal column contributes one to Δ. Inspect δ and a compact distance diagram.                           |
| 04   | Grow a Hamming ball  | Explore all 32 binary words of length five, change the center and radius, and optionally highlight the repetition code.                             |
| 05   | List decoding        | Read the guided explainer, compare exact one/two-candidate examples, grow the radius, and inspect every nearby polynomial.                          |
| 06   | Interleaved RS       | Edit two to four messages; follow each polynomial into an evaluation row. Inspect column tuples and compare shared versus separate error positions. |
| 07   | MCA                  | Grow codeword-centered balls along an affine family, count all challenges, and inspect exact same-support explanations or failures.                 |
| 08   | From codes to proofs | Edit trace evaluations, recover the polynomial with IFFT/Lagrange interpolation, extend it with FFT, and inspect a local FRI fold.                  |

**Tape editing:** Delete and Backspace edit digits normally. To remove a slot, use **Remove last coefficient**. Integer input is reduced modulo the selected field (for example, 20 becomes 3 in F₁₇); the typed digits stay visible until Enter or blur. Negative integers wrap too, and decimal integer strings are reduced exactly before conversion to JavaScript numbers. Empty or invalid drafts revert to the last valid coefficient.

The default RS example uses the prime field F₁₇, coefficients `[3, 2, 1]`, and evaluation points `0…7`. Its codeword is `[3, 6, 11, 1, 10, 4, 0, 15]`. Its minimum distance is 6 and its guaranteed unique-decoding radius is 2.

**List decoding** includes three short explanations: the definition, why multiple answers can fit, and the role of list-size bounds in STARK soundness. The example buttons load F₁₇ with k = 3 and n = 8; they separate the error count from the search radius so readers can grow the list while keeping the received word fixed. The explainer also distinguishes finding a candidate list from choosing the original message and interpolating a known clean codeword. Existing /visuals/decoding-radius links remain valid.

The guided corruption pattern has exactly one candidate at two errors and exactly two at three errors. The **Three-error example** button loads that ambiguity directly. The shared fixture is [rs-f17-k3-n8.json](../examples/rs-f17-k3-n8.json).

Experiments share the current polynomial and received word. Changing coefficients, block length, or field restores the received word to the new clean codeword. A compact polynomial stays visible in the later RS steps; the binary Hamming-ball universe has separate settings. **Reset** restores all experiments to their defaults.

**From codes to proofs** uses the same polynomial on a roots-of-unity domain. The initial trace is [6, 10, 2, 11] on [1, 4, 16, 13] in F₁₇. Its eight-value LDE is [6, 11, 10, 15, 2, 3, 11, 0]. The different evaluation points explain why this codeword differs from step 02. The trace length m is the next power of two at least as large as the message's coefficient count, with zero padding. Its degree bound is less than m, and the LDE rate is m/N.

The four views distinguish the prover's interpolation and extension work from the verifier's local folding relation. Change the first folded entry, then inspect different query pairs to see a failure or a missed alteration. This computes exact field arithmetic; it does not implement Merkle authentication, Fiat–Shamir, multiple FRI rounds, computation constraints, or zero-knowledge masking. A passing local check is not a complete proof. Fields or message lengths without a suitable FFT extension offer an explicit F₁₇ preset.

**Copy link** preserves the full experiment, including the field, message, received word, radius, and deterministic seed. Browser back/forward navigation restores the settings in those URLs. There is no browser-storage dependency.

**Interleaved RS** treats a column as one symbol in F_q^ℓ. The first row shares the earlier polynomial; other rows have independent editable messages with the same k slots. “Same column” versus “Different columns” keeps one changed entry per row but changes the column distance. It compares the reference and received matrices, not distance to the nearest interleaved codeword.

**MCA** has its own exact toy model: RS over F₅, k=2, n=5, and 25 codewords. For each of the five challenges γ, it forms u₀+γu₁. The green ball is centered on a selectable valid codeword, while the counts inspect all codewords. The parameter strip shows all challenge values; it does not claim to be a Euclidean embedding. A circle’s area is never used as probability.

The MCA failure event requires a set T of at least n−E positions where the combination agrees with a codeword but at least one input has no codeword explanation on the same T. This follows [WHIR §4.2, Definition 4.9](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1586), PDF retrieved September 13, 2026. Testing full candidate agreement sets is sufficient; tests independently check all 32 possible supports. Radius endpoints are finite-model experiments, not claims about an analytic theorem’s admissible range.

The growing-radius preset has proximity/MCA counts 0/0, 2/2, and 5/4 (out of five) at radii 0, 1, and 2. A line inside the code gives proximity 5/5 and MCA failure 0/5. These are exact fractions for selected inputs, not worst-case soundness bounds. The code alphabet and challenge field remain distinct concepts.

The last setting lets Vite read the existing Markdown notes from `../notes/`. Tests also consume fixtures from `../examples/`. The notes are bundled at build time, so the deployed app does not depend on a local filesystem or a separate notes server.

[vercel.json](./vercel.json) includes the SPA rewrite required for opening or refreshing a deep link such as `/visuals/hamming-ball`. No deployment has been created by this implementation.

See [Vercel's Vite documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/frontend/vite) for SPA routing and its [monorepo FAQ](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/monorepo-faq) for including files outside the root directory.

Add an experiment by creating a lesson module, adding its stable ID to `LESSON_IDS` in `src/state/model.ts`, and registering its metadata and lazy import in `src/lessons/registry.ts`. The shell automatically supplies navigation, grouping, step headings, note access, and previous/next links. Add the mathematics to `core/` rather than embedding it in layout code.

The notes remain ordinary Markdown in [notes/](../notes/). The notes dialog renders the relevant section of [grand_list_decoding.md](../notes/grand_list_decoding.md), [codes_to_proofs.md](../notes/codes_to_proofs.md) for the STARK lesson, or [reed-solomon-soundness.md](../notes/agentic_notes/reed-solomon-soundness.md) for the agreement lessons, with math support and a download of the source. Mermaid blocks in the source are displayed as code.

## Mathematical conventions and limits

- The initial arithmetic engine supports the prime fields F₅, F₇, and F₁₇. Switching fields loads a fresh preset. It does not silently reinterpret an existing experiment.
- The message has `k` coefficient slots, even when trailing coefficients are zero. The zero polynomial has no ordinary nonnegative degree.
- The first five lessons use the ordered RS domain `0…n−1`. Parameters satisfy `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ q`. The STARK lesson uses its own power-of-two multiplicative domains, with `m < N` and `N` dividing `q−1`; it does not reinterpret the earlier received word on those domains.
- Rate is the exact derived fraction `k/n`; the rate selector only offers attainable choices.
- Errors `e = Δ(c,w)` and search radius `E` are separate quantities. They can be linked for the guided decoding experiment.
- Crossing `t = floor((n−k)/2)` ends the worst-case unique-decoding guarantee. A particular received word can still have a unique candidate beyond it.
- Candidate lists are exact when available. Enumeration is capped at 10,000 codewords and 250,000 coordinate evaluations per search. Above the cap, a known codeword at distance e determines a singleton list when e ≤ E and e + E < d. At E = 0, interpolation followed by re-evaluation determines membership exactly. Other cases show **Count unavailable**, keep the reference codeword visible, and offer a small example. Unknown counts are never displayed as zero.
- The nearby-polynomials diagram draws a subset of codewords; its count searches the complete supported codebook. It does not enumerate the ambient space F₁₇⁸.
- Ball membership uses exact Hamming distances. Circular layouts preserve distance from the selected center, not all pairwise distances. Integer rings show shell distances; labels appear for the center, selection, hover, and keyboard focus. The zero-radius ball uses a minimum visible marker, and contains only the center word.
- The binary repetition code `{00000,11111}` is a separate teaching example, not a Reed–Solomon code.
- Shared JSON fixtures encode field elements as decimal strings to support future Rust/Lean examples without JavaScript integer rounding. The current TypeScript engine accepts only its documented small fields.
- Exhaustive checks are not Lean proofs. The fixture records that it is not formally verified.

## Planned features

These are future experiments, separate from the eight implemented lessons. The new subject-based notes have a detailed [visual sequence and implementation plan](../plans/research-notes-visuals.md).

Next from those notes:

| Planned visual                            | What the interaction will teach                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Build an interpolant                      | Select monomials, build finite-field constraints, and inspect exact rank, nullity, and a kernel witness.                                   |
| Hasse derivatives and jets                | Read the local expansion as a coefficient tape and track characteristic-dependent factorials.                                              |
| Contact and support root mass             | Count vanishing orders on the actual agreement set and inspect the inequality forcing a quotient to vanish.                                |
| Shared factors and differential equations | See why a nonzero kernel can retain a forbidden factor, and when a derivative equation adds an independent condition.                      |
| Source support optimization               | Explore interval dependencies and source/counting tradeoffs.                                                                               |
| First-jet balance                         | Compare the leading-model transition with exact finite discriminants; distinguish it from a certified soundness ceiling.                   |
| From experiment to certificate            | Connect source, domain, component, and budget obligations, with explicit evidence status.                                                  |

Further foundations and STARK visuals:

| Planned visual                       | What the interaction will teach                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| FRI across rounds                    | Follow linked queries through successive folds, Merkle authentication, and the final degree check.              |
| From constraints to proximity        | Connect trace constraints, quotient polynomials, and low-degree testing in a complete STARK example.            |
| Why d = n−k+1                        | Compare two polynomials and relate shared evaluations to the roots of their difference.                         |
| Find the worst received word         | Compare a particular list with the maximum list size over all centers in a fully enumerable tiny example.       |
| Rate versus decoding thresholds      | Compare unique decoding, Johnson, and capacity benchmarks with their assumptions and finite-length corrections. |
| Errors versus erasures               | Compare unknown corruptions with known missing positions and explore the budget `2e+s ≤ n−k`.                   |
| Folding                              | Bundle positions of one evaluation tape and see how the alphabet and Hamming metric change.                     |
| Roots-of-unity domains and cosets    | Traverse structured evaluation domains and inspect their algebraic relations.                                   |
| MDS through generator-matrix columns | Select Vandermonde columns and compute their exact finite-field rank.                                           |
| Higher-order MDS                     | Inspect intersections of several column spans using verified small examples.                                    |
| Correlated agreement                 | Highlight shared agreement coordinates and inspect combinations of words.                                       |
| Soundness in bits                    | Convert stated error bounds into bits with explicit parameters and hypotheses.                                  |
| Counterexample workbench             | Load Rust-generated or formally checked fixtures and inspect their words and agreement sets.                    |

Future MCA extensions can compare radius-versus-error profiles, additional challenge distributions, and certified bounds. Any worst-case claim needs a sourced theorem with its hypotheses; the implemented finite examples do not establish one.

The longer design and implementation plan is [plans/rs-visual-lab.md](../plans/rs-visual-lab.md).
